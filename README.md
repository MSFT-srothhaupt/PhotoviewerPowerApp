# PhotoviewerPowerApp
This repo is for a PowerApp that integrates into Teams and displays Photos.

You can browse Photos, that are stored in a DocLib on Sharepoint through this App.
When you have selected the Photo-Folder you want to view, you can start a slide-show with different kinds of transitions.

This App was built with Power Apps Studio.
